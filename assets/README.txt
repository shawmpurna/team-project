Place your logo image here as `logo.png`.

Recommended:
- File: `assets/logo.png` (PNG preferred; JPEG also works)
- Square image around 256â€“512px for best rendering

This file is referenced by all pages via `<img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Street Greek" />`.
If the image is not present, pages will fallback to a text logo automatically.
